      "Based on the British Public School pattern with a highly regimented and demanding atmosphere, CCH aims at training young men to join the armed forces of Pakistan as well as other disciplines. We focus on year-round, holistic, and balanced curricular and wider curriculum activities with emphasis on leadership training spanning the spectrum. The objectives of academic excellence, character development, personality shaping, inculcating universal values, and citizenship are kept foremost as core principles in shaping our students.\n\nThe outcome of this environment during these impactful years has brought our students to consistently rise to the top and exhibit excellence as second nature. It is for this reason that CCH claims to be \"shaping excellence\" as its creed.\n\nOver the past seven decades, our alumni have not only made impactful contributions to the national mainstream but have also crossed international boundaries and are now playing significant roles at the global level. Keeping pace with modern imperatives, CCH is well on its way to establishing itself as a globally-competitive international school.\n\nOur aim is to shape our cohorts towards becoming global leaders in their chosen fields of influence. Understanding the complexity of the global village, we encourage our students to venture beyond national boundaries and partake in the cosmopolitan, interconnected world. It is with much humility and pride that we claim the sobriquet of \"Second to None\".",
